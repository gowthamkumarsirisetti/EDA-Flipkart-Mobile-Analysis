# 📊 Flipkart Mobile EDA Project

This project is a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on mobile phones listed on **Flipkart**, India’s largest e-commerce platform. The dataset was generated by scraping 200+ pages using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and `requests`.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Flipkart hosts hundreds of smartphones, but users face difficulty comparing features, prices, and reviews. Sellers also need clear insights to optimize pricing and feature listings.  
This EDA project solves both by analyzing key patterns from real Flipkart listings.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🔍 Scrape smartphone data using web scraping
- 🧹 Clean and normalize messy scraped data
- 📈 Perform EDA to discover price, rating, brand, and feature patterns
- 📊 Visualize insights for business and customer use
- 💬 Provide recommendations based on real trends

## 🗃️ Dataset Source

- Website: [https://www.flipkart.com](https://www.flipkart.com)
- Pages Scraped: 200+
- Tools: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `re`, `pandas`

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed missing/garbage values
- Cleaned special characters (`₹`, `%`)
- Converted fields to correct data types
- Extracted features using regex: Brand, RAM, Storage, Battery, Model
- Added derived features: Discounted Price, Price Segment, Effective Storage

## 📊 Key Insights

### 📌 Univariate Analysis:
- Most mobiles priced between ₹10K–₹20K
- 5000 mAh battery and 8 GB RAM are the most common
- Most phones have 4.2–4.5 star ratings
- Discounts of 15%–35% dominate the market

### 📌 Bivariate Analysis:
- Phones with higher RAM → Higher ratings and price
- Premium phones (16 GB RAM, 256+ GB Storage) are highest rated
- Top-rated phones fall in ₹30K+ segment
- Budget brands (LAVA, POCO) provide value in low-cost range

---

## 💡 Conclusions

- Mid-range mobiles (₹10K–₹20K) dominate listings and customer demand
- RAM, battery capacity, and brand influence both price and rating
- Battery size doesn't guarantee better reviews — performance matters more
- Data-driven insights can help buyers compare better and sellers price smarter
